## Openclassroom project nÂ°6

This project is about testing the possibility to classify products of mass consomation using their text description or their image.
After studying the possibility of it, i made an algorithm using a neural network based model to do it from images.
Also, the entreprise needed some researchs in an API for products based on champagne.

Several methods are used during all the project such as BERT for text encoding or VGG16 google's neural network for images.
The notebook named 1&2 are the one with all the image/text part
Notebook 3 is the one for the API research
The presentation is what was used to show the work to openclassroom's jury.
